# `docs/` — the one-page map
Short files (each ≤50 lines) on what lives where and how to poke the live
game. Keep them this short: nobody opens a long file twice.

Full goal: [RUST-MW2-SKATE.md](RUST-MW2-SKATE.md); [loadout/damage component](RUST-SERVER-MOD.md); standalone rewrite paused.
Historical standalone goals and verified status: [../TODO.md](../TODO.md).
The inherited run/import guides below document optional upstream modes.
