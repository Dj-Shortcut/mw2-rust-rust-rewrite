# Rust PC skate client

A plugin for the existing Rust PC client that puts the local player on a skateboard: pushing,
braking and carving, rolling on slopes, ollies, kickflips and heelflips, half spins that end in
switch stance, grabs, manuals, grinding along edges, bails, a score with combos, a rider pose on
the game's own player model, a view from behind, sounds and a score display. It is ridden with a
controller, laid out as in the skate. games, or with keys. It belongs to
[#337](https://github.com/Dj-Shortcut/mw2-rust-skate-rewrite/issues/337) and the
[complete flow](../../../docs/RUST-MW2-SKATE.md); the calculations it shares with the server
plugin are in [`../shared`](../shared/README.md).

The plugin is loaded by BepInEx (IL2CPP). On the client that runs it, it changes the velocity of
the local player's movement body, the pose in which the local player's model is drawn and the
position of the main camera, and it adds a board, sounds and a score display of its own. It sends
nothing to the server: to the server the rider is a player who moves.

## Rules

- It is used only on the owner's own server, which runs without anti-cheat. Rust is started for it
  through `RustClient.exe`, the executable that does not start the anti-cheat.
- The mod loader is in the Rust folder only while one session runs. Every way of starting a
  session here puts it there and takes it out again; see [the tools](tools/README.md#a-session).
  Rust must not be started normally while the loader is in its folder.
- The server address, the key with which the PC reads this repository, game files, built binaries
  and logs stay out of this repository.

## Controls

### Controller

The layout of the skate. games. The plugin gets the controller itself from a reader outside the
game; see [The controller](#the-controller).

| Control | On the ground | In the air |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Y` | Get on; again gets off. | |
| Left stick | Steer, by how far it is pushed. Far and straight forward or back: push or brake. | Held more than half way to a side: frontside or backside 180 |
| `A` or `X` | Push | |
| `B` | Brake | |
| Right stick | Held back and flicked forward: ollie, stronger the longer it was held, up to 0.3 s. Flicked to a forward diagonal instead: ollie with a kickflip (to the rider's heel side) or a heelflip. Kept part of the way back for 0.2 s: manual. | Flicked to a side or a forward diagonal: a flip, kickflip to the heel side. Pulled back: set for the pop after the landing. |
| `LT` or `RT` | | Held: grab |
| Right stick click | View from behind or the game's first person | |

The rider's heel side is the stick's left; riding switch it is the stick's right. The steering
turns the board at a rate; the view does not steer it.

### Keys

| Key | On the ground | In the air |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `K`, or `Space` twice quickly | Get on. `K` again gets off. | |
| `W` | Push | Tap: kickflip |
| `S` | Brake | Tap: heelflip |
| `A` / `D` | Carve | Frontside / backside 180 |
| Mouse | The board turns toward the view | |
| `Space` | Ollie; on a grind, ollie off | |
| `Shift` | Held while rolling: manual | |
| `Ctrl` or `C` | Held for a moment: get off | Held: grab |
| `L` | View from behind or the game's first person | |

Coming down over an edge while moving along it starts a grind. A trick only starts when the jump
lasts long enough to finish it. Tricks score when landed, grinds and manuals by the second; tricks
in a row multiply, and the combo is banked after a moment of plain rolling. Coming down faster than 12 m/s, or with a
rotation unfinished, is a bail: the combo is lost and the rider steps off. Water, death, a seat or
a vehicle also end the ride. Nothing is read from keyboard or controller while the cursor is free
(console, chat, inventory).

### The controller

Inside the game a controller is keys and a mouse: Steam Input stands between it and the game, and
no stick can be read there. A process that Steam did not start sees the controller itself.
[`tools/sticks.ps1`](tools/sticks.ps1) is such a process: every session starts it beside the
client, and it shares the controller's state (XInput) with the plugin in a named block of memory,
every change with the reader's own clock, so that a flick between two frames of the game is not
lost. The plugin feeds the right stick to the shared flick module change by change.

- The controller rides from the moment it is touched. The keyboard rides again when a riding key
  goes down while the controller has been at rest for half a second.
- Steam's layout for the owner's `RustClient` shortcut keeps sending keys and mouse for the same
  controller. Off the board that is what walks, looks and uses things, so the layout has to be one
  that sends keys and mouse (Steam's "Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse" template): with the layout
  "Gamepad" the controller does nothing in Rust. On the board the plugin ignores those keys while
  the controller rides; the game still gets them.
- While the camera is behind the rider, the item in the player's hands is kept out of its way.
- The reader's block is named `ShortcutSkatePad`; its layout is in `SkatePad.cs` and in
  `sticks.ps1` and has to be the same in both.

## The score display

Drawn with the engine's immediate GUI: the session's score at the top right, counting up when a
combo is banked; the open combo at the bottom centre, with its tricks in a row, their points, the
multiplier and a bar that runs out while the board rolls without a trick; the trick that just
landed, a running manual or grind, or a bail in the upper middle; the speed at the bottom left, and
the controls for the first seconds on the board. A client build keeps only the engine methods the
game itself calls, so the condensed system font, the flat panels and the bars are each tried once
and done without when they are missing; the plugin's log says which (`HUD ...`).

## Sources

[`sources.txt`](sources.txt) lists what is compiled into `ShortcutSkateClient.dll`. A bare path is
taken from the commit that is built. A line with a commit and a SHA-256 takes shared code from
that commit and must match the hash; that is for shared code that is ahead on another branch.

| File | Part |
| --- | --- |
| `Plugin.cs` | Entry point, steps, log. |
| `SkateRig.cs` | Finds the local player and its movement body, getting on and off, the per-frame order. |
| `SkateKeys.cs` | Keys and controller as one set of riding inputs; whose hands are on the ride. |
| `SkatePad.cs` | The controller's state from the reader outside the game; the right stick through the shared flick module. |
| `SkatePadLog.cs` | What a ride with a controller leaves in the log: every movement of the right stick, the keys Steam's layout sends, whether the stick turns the game's view. |
| `SkateRide.cs` | Ground, air, grind and bail movement; calls the shared trick module. |
| `SkateGrind.cs` | Samples the ground around the rider and asks the shared edge module for an edge. |
| `SkateBoard.cs` | The board, what it is drawn with and where it sits. |
| `RiderRig.cs` | Writes the shared rider pose onto the player model's skeleton; what is drawn in which view, the held item included. |
| `SkateCamera.cs` | View from behind. |
| `SkateHud.cs`, `SkateSfx.cs` | The score display and the sounds. |
| `Scenarios.cs` | Scripted checks in a world. |

### Steps

The plugin reads a comma-separated list from `BepInEx\plugins\steps.txt` when it loads; without the
file it runs `skate`.

| Step | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `skate` | The mod as the owner plays it. |
| `ride` | Scripted: ride out, brake, turn round, ride back, get off. |
| `pose` | Scripted: rider and board in each state, standing still, from fixed cameras, then the score display in nine made-up states; `K` steps on. |
| `trick` | Scripted: ollie, kickflip, heelflip, both spins, a grab, two presses that come too late and a manual. |
| `pad` | Scripted: the ride with a controller, played into the plugin without one. |
| `mute` | Turns the whole client down until nothing can be heard. |
| `nogrind` | No grinding. |

A scripted check writes what happened to `BepInEx\plugins\skate.log` and ends the session.

## What it relies on in the game

The client's own code is obfuscated and renamed with every build. The plugin uses only Unity's
engine API, the type names of game components (`BasePlayer`, `PlayerWalkMovement`, `PlayerModel`)
and Unity's message names. Each of the following was established in the running game and can
change with a Rust update:

- The local player is moved by a separate object with the walk component, a dynamic Rigidbody and
  a capsule. Velocity written after the game's own fixed step moves the player; the walk component
  has to stay enabled.
- The player model is a humanoid; its bones are taken from the Animator. A pose written after the
  game's animation in `LateUpdate` is what gets drawn.
- The local player's full body is set to cast shadows only, and a second set of meshes whose names
  start with `leg-` is what first person shows. The view from behind swaps the two.
- Only the main camera carries the game's image effects, so the view from behind moves it.
- `Rust/Standard` is the game's lit shader and can be found by name. A mesh the plugin makes and
  draws with it takes the world's light and casts a shadow; its colours come from a texture
  (`_MainTex`), its gloss from `_Glossiness`. `Hidden/Internal-Colored` draws vertex colours without
  light and is what the board falls back to.
- A controller is not visible to the plugin as a gamepad; keys and mouse buttons are read from the
  Input System, the controller from outside the game.
- The item in the player's hands is drawn by an object with a `BaseViewModel` component. Switching
  its renderers off does not hide it; scaling that object down every frame does.
- On a server without `ShortcutSkate`, in the scripted checks, where nothing touches mouse or
  keyboard, the first ride after waking is put back several times during its first two to three
  seconds, also at walking pace and also when it starts eight seconds after waking. Checks whose
  first movement came forty seconds or more after waking were not put back, nor was a second ride.
  The cause is not known.
- Engine methods the game never calls can be missing from the client and throw when called.

## Playing it: the owner's launcher

[`tools/launcher.ps1`](tools/launcher.ps1) builds the commit named in
[`tools/release.txt`](tools/release.txt) and puts two files on the desktop of the PC:

- **Rust Skate** starts Steam when it is not running, puts the loader and the plugin into the Rust
  folder, starts Rust through the owner's Steam shortcut, and takes everything out again when Rust
  is closed. Its window has to
  stay open while playing. A hidden helper does the same clean-up half a minute after Rust closes
  if that window was closed first.
- **Rust Skate - remove mod files** takes the loader out of the Rust folder by hand, for example
  after a power cut.

The launcher downloads nothing and builds nothing; it plays the plugin that was built when it was
installed. After a Rust update it refuses to start and says so, until the mod has been
[prepared for the new build](tools/README.md#after-a-rust-update). To remove everything, delete
the two desktop files and the folder `Downloads\claude-loader-probe`.

On the server, [`ShortcutSkate`](../plugins/SKATE.md) accepts the rider's speed and supplies a
practice area. The client asks it for nothing: the plugin accepts a rider by itself after a moment
of ordinary movement. Without it the server allows a rider the pace of a player who walks, about
10 km/h and a little more downhill, and puts a faster one back. The client learns a limit from
being put back twice within a second, holds it, tries a little more now and then, and says on
screen what the server is holding the board back to.
