// The game puts the main camera at the player's eyes every frame; moving it later in the same
// frame is what gives the view from behind. A second camera is not an alternative: it lacks the
// main camera's image effects. Sample() must run before Apply() moves the camera, or the rider
// steers by the moved camera.
